# how to run the web version

todo

make sure to `pip install requirements.txt` (pro tip: use a virtual environment.)

make sure to `git clone` the talktown directory from possibly/talktown/jukejoint-web (one day will be jor/talktown/jukejoint-web) onto the same level as app.py.

```
flask run app.py
```
