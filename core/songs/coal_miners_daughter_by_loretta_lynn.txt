"Coal Miner's Daughter" by Loretta Lynn

Well I was born the coal miner's daughter
in a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
[love]

that's the one thing that daddy made sure of
[commitment]

He shovel coal to make a poor man's dollar
My daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mine 
all day long in the field hoein' corn
[disappointment]

Mommie rocked the baby that night 
and read the Bible by the coal oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn
[commitment]

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommie scrubbed our clothes on a washboard everyday
[commitment]

Why I've seen her fingers bleed to complain there was no need
She's smiled in mommie's understanding way
[love]

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
[disappointment]

But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog money made by selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
[love]

Yeah I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
[love]

I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard at night we'd sleep cause we were tired
I never thought I'd ever leave the Butcher Holler
[commitment]

But a lots of things have changed since the way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
[love]

Not much left but the floor 
nothing lives there anymore
[disappointment]

Just the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter
[love]
