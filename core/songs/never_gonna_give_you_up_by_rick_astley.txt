"Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley

We're no strangers to love, 
You know the rules and so do I
[love]

A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
[commitment]

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
[love]

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
[commitment]

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
[commitment]

We've known each other for so long
[commitment]

Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
[disappointment]

Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
[love]

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
[disappointment]

(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
[commitment]

We've known each other for so long
[commitment]

Your heart's been aching, but
You're too shy to say it
[disappointment]

Inside, we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
[love]

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
[love]

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
[commitment]

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
[commitment]
