"The River" by Bruce Springsteen

I come from down in the valley
where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
[commitment]?

Me and Mary we met in high school
when she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
[love]

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride
[love]

Then I got Mary pregnant
and man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
[disappointment]

We went down to the courthouse
and the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress
[disappointment]

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride
[love]

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
[disappointment]

Now all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they vanished right into the air
[disappointment]

Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care
[disappointment]

But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
[love]

At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
[love]

Now those memories come back to haunt me
they haunt me like a curse
[disappointment]

Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse
that sends me down to the river
though I know the river is dry
[disappointment]

That sends me down to the river tonight
Down to the river
my baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride
[love]
